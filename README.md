# Earthquake Visualization with Leaflet

----

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I created a set of [toolkits](https://njgeorge000158.github.io/belly-button-challenge/) to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

To see the toolkits in action, click on the link or download and run the HTML file, index.html, with any browser, but make sure that the files and subfolders in the folder, /static, are also available.
